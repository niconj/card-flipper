# card-flipper
Vue 2 component implementation poc


## Project description

Implementation of a reusable **cards** component that will receive a numeric `amount` property and will display the same number of 'cards' one next to each other.

The cards can be either facing *up* or *down*, but only 1 card is allowed to be face up at the time.

When the user clicks on a face down card, it will be turned **up** and the rest of the cards will be facing **down**.
